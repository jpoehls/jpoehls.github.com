Up til now our RSS feed has been hosted by [Feedburner](http://feedburner.google.com). Its future has [been in question](http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/28/the-feedburner-deathwatch-continues-google-kills-adsense-for-feeds/) for awhile though and now seems like a good time for a tactical withdrawal.

Please update your subscriptions to use the new feed at [http://zduck.com/atom.xml](http://zduck.com/atom.xml).

I'll be switching off Feedburner soon. Thanks for reading!
