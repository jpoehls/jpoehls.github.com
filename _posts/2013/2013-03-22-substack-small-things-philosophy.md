Those of you who follow the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) community at all will recognize [substack](http://twitter.com/substack) as one of the most prolific package authors on [NPM](https://npmjs.org/~substack). You have probably also picked up on the fact that he is a big fan of small packages.

I ran across this interview the other day and I think substack communicates his "small things" philosophy well. Simply put, the UNIX philosophy works. Do one thing, do it well, and it will stand the test of time.

_Paraphrased from the video._
> If you want to be writing things that people will still be using in 20 years,  
> you've really gotta only do one thing. If you try to do other things, somebody else  
> will come along and do that one thing way better because they focused more.  
> So you're just wasting your time by writing big things because they won't be  
> with us in the future. It's really wasted effort.
