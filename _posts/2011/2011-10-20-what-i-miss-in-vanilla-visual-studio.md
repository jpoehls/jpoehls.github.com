title: What I miss in vanilla Visual Studio

For the past week or so I've gone without any Visual Studio enhancements. No [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper). No [CodeRush](http://www.devexpress.com/coderush). I knew that I didn't leverage even a fraction of what these tools offer so I wanted to find out what I would miss.

Here's what I'm missing the most. In no particular order.

1. **Detection of errors** _before_ I compile.

2. **Shortcut for moving a class** to its own file.

	I like to build up features in the same file (for speed) and then refactor the classes into their own files later. A tedius process of copy/paste.

3. **A rename function** that is smart enough to rename the file as well.

4. **Unit Test debugger.**

	I don't mind running tests in the NUnit GUI, it even feels faster sometimes, but I miss the ability to step into my tests. I use this feature a lot for exploring APIs.

5. **Ability to generate constructors.**

	Especially useful for creating custom exceptions where you want to implement all of the base constructors.

6. **Fast code snippets.**

	Visual Studio's built in snippets are functional, but slow to access compared to the alternatives so I ended up not using them. I definitely prefer CodeRush's snippets.
